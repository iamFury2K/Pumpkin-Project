Project Name: Seed Classification using Machine Learning

Description:
This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms for the classification of pumpkin seed varieties ('Urgup_Sivrisi' and 'Cercevelik'). Pumpkin seeds are widely consumed worldwide due to their nutritional content, making it essential to accurately classify them based on morphological features. The dataset used in this project contains morphological measurements of 2500 pumpkin seeds, and it has been made publicly available for research purposes.

The main objective of this project is to compare the performance of different machine learning models in accurately classifying the pumpkin seed varieties. The following algorithms have been utilized for this classification task:

Logistic Regression
Multilayer Perceptrons (Neural Networks)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest
XGBoost
k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
To achieve this, the dataset was preprocessed and transformed using standardization to ensure fair comparison across different models. The models were then trained and evaluated using k-fold cross-validation, a robust technique that maximizes data utilization and provides a more accurate performance estimate.

The project showcases the importance of machine learning in agricultural research, particularly in classifying seeds based on their features, which can aid in seed quality assessment and breeding programs. The results obtained from the various models are presented with confusion matrices and cross-validation accuracy scores, allowing users to identify the best-performing algorithm for this specific classification task.

By open-sourcing this project and providing the dataset, we aim to encourage further research and collaboration in the field of agricultural data analysis and machine learning. Researchers, enthusiasts, and learners can utilize this project as a starting point for their seed classification studies or adapt it for different classification tasks involving diverse datasets.

Note: The dataset and code are made publicly accessible for educational and research purposes, and we welcome contributions from the community to improve and extend the functionality of this project.
